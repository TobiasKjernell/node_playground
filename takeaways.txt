mongodb:
atlas is a gui version application for our database.
cluster is a instance of our db.

mongoose:
a ODM(Object Data Modeling) on top of mongoDB and nodejs.
It provides us the ability to modal schemas and much more.
Schema is a blueprint of the document/data we writing, similiar to classes in C#

Aggregation:
Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results.

Not only do we have the ability to aggregate data on the client side with JavaScript,
but we can use MongoDB to run operations on the server against our collections stored in the database before the result is returned to the client.

Aggregations overrides your schema values and create new variables.
This might be useful since you can do calculations with this pipeline and return new values
to client.

Schema Virtuals:
Virtuals are a powerful feature in Mongoose that allow us to add attributes to documents without actually storing them in the database. These properties can be dynamically calculated based on other fields, making it easier to manage and manipulate your data. In this comprehensive article, we’ll dive into Mongoose Schema Virtuals, explaining how to use virtuals for computed properties in your Mongoose models.

What are Mongoose Schema Virtuals?
Mongoose Schemas Virtuals are document attributes that only exist logically and are not written to the document's collection in the MongoDB database. They do not persist or get stored there. When we access the virtual property, Mongoose calls the get method.

Virtual property setters are applied before other validation. For example, a virtual property can be used to combine first and last names into a full name, or format a date field. Virtuals are helpful for transforming or combining data without altering the actual structure of the database.

Efficient Data Handling: Virtuals help keep your database clean by allowing you to compute data dynamically without storing it in the database.
Cleaner Code: They allow you to encapsulate logic for computed properties, such as concatenating names, calculating totals, or formatting data, directly within the schema.
Improved Data Integrity: Virtuals ensure that derived fields are always consistent, making your application logic easier to maintain.

Schema Pre():

The pre() method in Mongoose is used to define pre-hooks (middleware functions) that run before the execution of certain operations on Mongoose documents or queries. This allows us to perform operations such as validation,
    logging, or document modification before saving, updating, or deleting data in your MongoDB collections. The pre() method is called on a Mongoose schema and attaches middleware to a specific schema method (e.g., save(), update(), find()).
