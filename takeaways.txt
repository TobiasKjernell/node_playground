mongodb:
atlas is a gui version application for our database.
cluster is a instance of our db.

mongoose:
a ODM(Object Data Modeling) on top of mongoDB and nodejs.
It provides us the ability to modal schemas and much more.
Schema is a blueprint of the document/data we writing, similiar to classes in C#

Aggregation:
Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results.

Not only do we have the ability to aggregate data on the client side with JavaScript,
but we can use MongoDB to run operations on the server against our collections stored in the database before the result is returned to the client.

Aggregations overrides your schema values and create new variables.
This might be useful since you can do calculations with this pipeline and return new values
to client.
